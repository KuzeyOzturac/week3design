## Description
We are considering developing an application that tracks the coordinates of the TTC non-subway vehicles. The user will state which station they are at. We are going to provide the user with a list of each route and how much time it will take for the vehicle to arrive. We are going to use route numbers to track vehicles.
## Screenshot
We asked the API for a list of all vehicle locations that were part of route 510 (streetcar along Spadina).
