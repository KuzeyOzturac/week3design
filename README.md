## Description
We are thinking of developing an application that tracks the latitude and longitude coordinations of the TTC non-subway vehicles. The user will state which route they are on. Using the route number, we will track the closest vehicle and return its latitude and longitude coordinates.
## Screenshot
We asked the API for a list of all vehicle locations that were part of route 510 (streetcar along Spadina).
