## Description of Domain
We are planning on pursuing a project within the domain of data analysis. Our project will specifically analyze public data about Toronto's TTC buses and streetcars, and will present this data in an easy-to-visualize manner.
## High-Level Description of Project
We are considering developing an application that tracks the coordinates of the TTC non-subway vehicles. The user will state which station they are at. We are going to provide the user with a list of each route and how much time it will take for the vehicle to arrive. We are going to use route numbers to track vehicles.
## API Documentation
Documentation for our API can be found in [xml-feed-documentation.pdf](./xml-feed-documentation.pdf).
## Screenshot
We asked the API for a list of all vehicle locations that were part of route 510 (streetcar along Spadina).
